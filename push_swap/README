# push_swap

## Description

The **push_swap** project is about sorting a stack of integers using a very limited set of operations and only two stacks: **stack A** and **stack B**.

At the beginning, all numbers are placed in stack A and stack B is empty.  
The goal is to sort stack A in ascending order while producing the smallest possible number of operations.

To solve the problem, I chose to use the **Radix Sort** algorithm, adapting it to work with stacks and the limited set of operations allowed in the project.

## Instructions

### Compilation

To compile the project, run:

```bash
make
```
This will generate the executable push_swap.

You can also use the following commands:
```bash
make clean
```
Removes object files.

```bash
make fclean
```
Removes object files and the executable.

```bash
make re
```
Recompiles the project.

### Execution

The program takes integers as arguments.

Example:
```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

It also supports numbers passed as a string:
```bash
./push_swap "4 67 3 87 23"
```
The program outputs the list of operations needed to sort the stack to the standard output.

### Error Handling
The program prints ```Error``` and exits if:
- No arguments are provided
- An argument is not a valid integer
- There are duplicated numbers
- An integer overflow occurs
- The input format is invalid

- AI Usage - ChatGPT was used as a learning and support tool during the development of this project.  
	It helped me clarify doubts about the push_swap rules, understand the Radix Sort algorithm, review edge cases.
	All the implementation, logic decisions, and testing were done by me.
